# Material-Design-Electron-Boilerplate
A simple boilerplate for Electron including a custom window frame. Just unzip the folder and the Example App folder. 
Change Everything that says Audium (the example app's name) to your app name! Change everything to meet your app's 
needs. I only styled the window and scrollbar, feel free to change ANYTHING YOU WANT!
